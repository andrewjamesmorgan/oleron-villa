The island is popular with both families and surfers due to the beautiful beaches, outdoor activities and delicious local food - especially, fish, seafood, fruit & vegetables and Pineau - the local drink. The house is very modern (completed in January 2012) and is set up to provide a very comfortable place to stay and can sleep ten or more people. There is plenty of space outside for kids to play and adults to eat, drink and unwind but the beaches are the main attraction for the island and they are just a few minutes away via a short walk through the woods.</p><p>Perfect for families and groups seeking a peaceful getaway on the beautiful Île d'Oléron.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>You should find everything you need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
